# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: July 30, 2021

**Today's Progress:**
* Outputting to the console
* Declaring variables
* Naming conventions
* Getting input from the user
* Manipulating strings

**Thoughts:** This wasn't too bad as the concepts are basically the same as Python and it was just a case of learning the syntax.

### Day 2: July 31, 2021

**Today's Progress:**
* Data types
* Type conversion
* Mathematical operations
* Rounding numbers
* Setting precision for std::cout and std::wcout
* Setting environment up to print UTF-8 characters to the Windows console (purely to print '£' character).

**Thoughts:** Today took some googling to get the two projects completed but otherwise was fairly straight forward.

### Day 3: August 1, 2021

**Today's Progress:**
* If  - else statements
* Else If
* Comparing Floats
* Conditional operators
* Modulo
* Nested If
* Logical operators
* Updated BMI Calculator from yesterday with If-else-if statements to determine BMI status
* Leap Year Calculator
* Using raw string literals to draw ascii art
* Treasure Island

**Thoughts:**

### Day 4: August 2, 2021

**Today's Progress:**
* Generate random numbers
* Arrays
* Randomly select an element from an array
* Rock Paper Scissors


**Thoughts:** This took me a lot longer to get my head around than I expected. Although arrays in c++ are similar to lists in python, there are some things that appear more complex.

### Day 5: August 3, 2021

**Today's Progress:**
* While Loops
* Do While Loops
* For Loops
* Range-based for loop
* FizzBuzz
* Password Generator


**Thoughts:** Today was quite fun, especially solving how to randomly sort the final password in the Password Generator program.

### Day 6: August 4, 2021

**Today's Progress:**
* Switch statements
* Defining functions
* Return values
* Function parameters
* Headers and Prototypes


**Thoughts:** This was another fairly straight forward day. Conceptually, functions are fairly similar in C++ to what they are in Python. The final project turned out to be reasonably straightforward to program.

### Day 7: August 5, 2021
**Today's progress:**
* No additional learning, but coding Hangman to reinforce the things I've already learned to this point


**Thoughts:** While I didn't learn anything new today, coding the Hangman program was a good exercise as it helped reinforce the things I've learned in the first week. I'm also happy that I was able to refactor the code to have separate files for each function along with a header file of forward definitions.

### Day 8: August 6, 2021
**Today's progress:**
* Nothing new, more reinforcement.

**Thoughts:** I had absolutely zero motivation today, so decided to create a simple Prime Number Checker program, as something I could concentrate on.

### Day 9: August 7, 2021
**Today's progress:**
* Classes
* Data Members
* C++ Constructors and Destructors
* C++ Getters and Setters
* C++ String Streams

**Thoughts:** While I did manage to learn the little bit about classes above, I've had too many interruptions from family to have time to get to the projects I had planned to do.

**Link to work:** N/A

### Day 10: August 8, 2021
**Today's progress:**
* Completed the Caesar Cypher project that I intended to do yesterday

**Thoughts:** This was fun, although I had a fair amount of searching to solve some of the challenges I had on this one.

### Day 11: August 9, 2021
**Today's progress:**
* Overloading constructors
* The 'this' keyword
* Constructor initialisation lists

**Link to Work:** N/A

### Day 12: August 10, 2021
**Today's progress:**
* C++ std::map<type, type> name { {key, value} };
* Getting the highest value from a std::map

### Day 13: August 11, 2021
**Today's progress:**
* Pointers
* Arithmetic
* Pointers & Arrays
* Pointer Arithmetic
* Create a map of functions
* Call the functions from the map

**Thoughts:** I enjoyed today, as I was learning concepts I'd not really encountered before, even with Python programming.

### Day 14: August 12, 2021
**Today's progress:**
* Char arrays
* Reversing a string
* References
* Const Keyword

**Thoughts:** Today was interesting. I'm not sure I fully understand the use cases for pointers and references just yet, but hopefully I'll pick them up as I continue.

### Day 15: August 16, 2021
**Today's progress:**
* Copy constructors
* The ‘new’ operator
* Returning objects from functions
* Allocating memory
* Arrays and Functions
* Namespaces


**Thoughts:** After not having time for the last couple of days, it was good to be able to sit down and code today.
