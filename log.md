# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: July 30, 2021

**Today's Progress:**
* Outputting to the console
* Declaring variables
* Naming conventions
* Getting input from the user
* Manipulating strings

**Thoughts:** This wasn't too bad as the concepts are basically the same as Python and it was just a case of learning the syntax.

### Day 2: July 31, 2021

**Today's Progress:**
* Data types
* Type conversion
* Mathematical operations
* Rounding numbers
* Setting precision for std::cout and std::wcout
* Setting environment up to print UTF-8 characters to the Windows console (purely to print 'Â£' character).

**Thoughts:** Today took some googling to get the two projects completed but otherwise was fairly straight forward.
