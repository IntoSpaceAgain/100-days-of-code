# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: July 30, 2021

**Today's Progress**:
* Outputting to the console
* Declaring variables
* Naming conventions
* Getting input from the user
* Manipulating strings

**Thoughts:** This wasn't too bad as the concepts are basically the same as Python and it was just a case of learning the syntax.
